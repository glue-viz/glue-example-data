### Dataset: Earthquakes in 2010

This folder contains a CSV file (``earthquakes_2010.csv``) that contains
earthquakes from the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/) database recorded in
2010. This is not necessarily a complete record of all known earthquakes and it
is not complete especially at the lower magnitude range.
