    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use the glue-jupyter package to explore Astronomical data for W5, which is a region in space where stars are currently forming. However, much of the functionality shown here would be applicable to other image and tabular datasets. In this notebook, we follow a similar analysis to that shown in the [Getting started](http://docs.glueviz.org/en/latest/getting_started/index.html) guide for the Qt-based glue application.\n",

    "### About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using are ``w5.fits``, an image at 12Âµm taken with the [Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-field_Infrared_Survey_Explorer), and ``w5_psc.csv``, a table of forming stars found in this region using the [Spitzer Space Telescope](http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/).\n",
